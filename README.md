# HackAI : Team Crion's submission
This one a tough one wasn't it, well it had its ups and downs. But we here at crion's are happy to have had the opportunity to take part in this event.

## Problem
Moroccan public education institutions has a major deficiency in availability of academic consultants, we want to democratize access for it.

## Solution
The remedy is as everything else is in the modern world, AI and Machine Learning; We create a agentic langchain composed of multiple instances of the same Large Language Model `gemini-2.0-flash` where it plays multiple roles, from a translator, to a RAG assisted specialist in Post-Bac Education prospects. 

## What have we learned
We have tried to maximize our surface application area of every challenge we solved during the mini-challenges period. We have agents, that communicate using MCP. That have LLMs that were pretrained and finetuned with Causal Language Modeling. In addition to Retrieval Augmented Generation.
